# EmotionsDetect

<b>Introduction </b> <br>
With the increase of Smartphone use, there is a growing need for advanced features that offer to Smartphone users a smarter
interaction. We aim through the presented system to detect users’ emotions from their textual exchanges, dealing with the
complexity of chat writing style and the evolution of languages. We consider that such a system is a start for interesting
applications that exploit users’ emotional states. 

Emotions detection is of great importance in understanding people’s true sentiments and opinions. Application of emotions detection can benefit many areas of interest of NLP applications, including marketing research, opinion mining and information categorization.
